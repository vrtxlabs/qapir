# About

`qapir` is a comprehensive **no-code** framework designed for API testing, providing a user-friendly syntax, integrated
reporting, support for complex multi-step scenarios, customizable retries, and test parameterization, among other
features.
As a lightweight binary, `qapir` functions effectively as both a development tool and a test runner, easily integrating
into Continuous Integration pipelines.

Users can define scenarios using `YAML` format, execute individual tests or entire test suites, and generate detailed,
human-readable reportsâ€”all with a single command.

We value feedback from our users. If you find `qapir` useful, please consider giving us a **GitHub Star**. If you
encounter any issues, please log them via GitHub. For feature requests or suggestions for improvements, we encourage you

# Getting started with `qapir`

### Step 1: Initialize `.qapir` workspace in your project

```
cd /path/to/your/project
qapir init
```

### Step 2: Configure Environments

The `qapir` environment refers to a collection of environment variables utilized in tests.
The files that store environment variables are located in the `.qapir/environments` directory.
How to define `qapir` environment files is described [here](docs/Environment.md).

### Step 3: Define Tests

The `qapir` test is a collection of test steps, each defined by a set of actions and validators.
`qapir` uses a specialized language called `qtl` that provides a variety of test validators.
`qapir` also allows for defining and modifying test variables at runtime, which can be used within the scope of a test
run.
To learn more about test definition and `qtl`, please proceed [here](docs/Test.md)

#### Group Tests

A collection of `qapir` tests grouped together is called a test suite.
To learn more about test suites, please proceed [here](docs/Test.md/#suite).

### Step 4: Run Tests

#### `cd` into `.qapir` directory of your project
```
cd .qapir
```

#### Run a test suite

```
qapir run suite -f {path-to-suite-yml} -e {path-to-environment-yml}
```

#### Run an individual test

```
qapir run test -f {path-to-test-yml} -e {path-to-environment-yml}
```

### Step 5: Review Test Reports in Browser

After every run, `qapir` will generate a one-file html report with all executed tests.
Reports are saved in `.qapir/reports` directory as `${timestamp}.html` files.

# Known limitations

1. `jsonpath` expressions with multiple filters are not supported. As a workaround, filter by one criterion, store the
   value in a variable, and then filter by the next criterion.
2. `jsonpath` expressions that filter based on the absence of a field are not supported at this time, and there is no
   available workaround.
3. `qtl` statements are not validated for correctness yet. Please refer to the examples provided in this repository for
   guidance.
